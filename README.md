**Me**
> My name is Luka Stein and I am a student at the University of Applied Sciences Hanzehogeschool Groningen.
> Currently I am in the third year of the bachelor Bio-informatics :books:

**Syllabus** ðŸ’¬
> Here we learn several concepts in biology and practising programming, scripting in several languages. \
> For theory we learn about Genetics, Proteomics and DNA sequencing methods. :dna: \
> We learned programming in Python, Java and webdeveloping with those languages in combination with Flask or Tomcat. \
> For statistical analysis we've learnt to use R (in Rstudio).

> Furthermore we learn about several algorithms how they actually work and their Big O (time complexity). \
> Additionally a topic we are teached about which I find really interesting are basic machine learning algorithms. \
> Also we learned about using git and basic linux command line usage.

## Personal projecting ðŸ”­
* I'm currently pursuing the minor Advanced Datamining, where I learn how to make neural networks in Python and how to make Snakemake pipelines.
* Also I enjoy fiddling around with the linux environment and learning more commands for more efficient usage along working.
* Currently I'm eager to learn more about Julia.
* I've been working quite a bit in vim, but recently stepped over to neovim (a fork of vim) for setting up a prettier working environment using NvChad [NeovimPersonalSetup](https://github.com/Coldbirdie/NeovimPersonalSetup).
